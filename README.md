# CodeGymGames
Here is the section where I uploaded the code I wrote for games such as Snake, Minesweeper or 2048.
These games were written as part of the Code Gym online course.
In order to run the game, it is necessary to download and install the Cody Gym tasks project and import their original 'codegym.engine.cell' engine.

Instructions on how to install and configure the project can be found in the following links:
